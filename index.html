          What happens when our component needs something that outside of itself ? 
           How to access data from outside the component ? 
           For example , what if the parent so to speak had this message data and the child needed it ?
           They can't because component has its own isolated scope, it can't reach up outside of itself to grab something that's outside of its scope.

          So the answer here is props.
          These are custom attributes for passing data into a component.
          They function kind of like a funnel into which you can pass the data that component needs.

      <div class="nav-bar"></div>

      <div class="cart">Cart({{ cart }})</div>
      <product-display @add-to-cart="updateCart"></product-display>
    </div>

    <!-- Import App -->
    <script src="./main.js"></script>
    <script src="components/ProductDisplay.js"></script>

    <!-- Mount App -->
    <script>
      const mountedApp = app.mount("#app");
